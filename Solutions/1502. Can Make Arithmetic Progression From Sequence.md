# Description
A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers arr, return true if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression. Otherwise, return false.

# Example
Input: arr = [3,5,1]

Output: true

Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
1. If there are only two numbers, we can make any arithmetic sequence.
2. Sort the array in order to check we can make arithmetic sequence.
3. Sorting works because arithmetic sequence has only two cases: increasing or decreasing pattern.
# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. If the size of arr is 2, return true. 
2. Sort the vector.
3. Calculate the difference and compare the differences.
4. Through the comparison, check whether the difference between each terms is maintained or not.
5. If the difference is not maintained, arithmetic sequence, which has common difference, cannot not generated.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector arr.
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
``` cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canMakeArithmeticProgression(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size(); // number of elements
        if (n == 2) return true; // If there are only two numbers, we can make sequence
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end()); // greedy approach : sorting the number
        int commonDiff = arr[1] - arr[0]; 
        
        for (int i = 2; i < n ; ++i) {
            int curDiff = arr[i] - arr[i -1];
            // through the comparison, we can know the the difference btw terms is maintained or not
            if (curDiff != commonDiff) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
