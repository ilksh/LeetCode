# Description
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

# Example
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

Output: [0,1]

Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].


# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
We can iterate over the array and check if the difference between the target and the current number exists in the array. If it does, we have found the two numbers that add up to the target.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Create an unordered map to store the numbers and their indices.
2. Iterate over the input vector and insert each number and its index into the unordered map.
3. Iterate over the input vector again:
- Calculate the difference between the target and the current number.
- Check if the difference exists in the unordered map.
- If it does and the difference is not the current number itself:
    - Add the current index to the result vector.
    - Add the index of the difference to the result vector.
    - Return the result vector since the target is found.
4. If no solution is found, return an empty result vector.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(n), where n is the size of the input vector. 
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(n), where n is the size of the input vector.

# Code
``` cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int,int> umap; // Create an unordered map to store the numbers and their indices
        vector<int> rst; // Create a vector to store the resulting indices
        int sz = nums.size(); // Get the size of the input vector
        
        // Iterate over the input vector and insert each number and its index into the unordered map
        for (int i=0; i < sz; ++i)
            umap.insert({nums[i],i});
        
        // Iterate over the input vector again
        for (int i=0; i < sz; ++i) {
            // Calculate the difference between the target and the current number
            int diff = target - nums[i]; 
    
            // Check if the difference exists in the unordered map
            if (umap.find(diff) != umap.end()) {
                if (umap[diff] != i) { // Make sure the difference is not the current number itself
                    rst.push_back(i); // Add the current index to the result vector
                    rst.push_back(umap[diff]); // Add the index of the difference to the result vector
                    return rst; // Return the result vector since the target is found
                }
            }
        }
        
        return rst; // If no solution is found, return an empty result vector
    }
};
