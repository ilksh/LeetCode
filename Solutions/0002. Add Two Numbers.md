# Description
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 

Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

# Example
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]

Output: [7,0,8]

Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Add the values of each node and store them in a linked list containing only the result values

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Iterate every nodes of two linked lists
2. Add values from the each nodes and Store the sum to the variable (sum)
3. Store the tenth digit number to variable (carry) and move to the next node
4. Add ones digit number to the result node (tail)
5. Iteration ends when two linkedlist nodes reach to the end and the tenth digit number is zero

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(max(n, m)), where n and m are the lengths of the input linked lists l1 and l2, respectively. 
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(max(n, m)), where n and m are the lengths of the input linked lists l1 and l2, respectively. 
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
``` cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        // Declare a pointer to the head of the new linked list
        ListNode* head = nullptr;
        // Declare a pointer to a pointer to the current node of the new linked list
        ListNode** tail = &head;
    
        int carry = 0;
        
        // Loop until both input lists and the carry value are null.
        while (true) {
            if (l1 == nullptr && l2 == nullptr && carry == 0) break;
            int sum = carry; // Start from the value that passed from the previous step
            
            // If l1 is not null, add its value and move l1 to the next node.
            if (l1 != nullptr) {
                sum += l1->val;
                l1 = l1->next;
            }
            
            // If l2 is not null, add its value and move l2 to the next node.
            if (l2 != nullptr) {
                sum += l2->val;
                l2 = l2->next;
            }
            
            carry = sum / 10; // Calculate the new carry value
            *tail = new ListNode(sum % 10); // Create a new node with the ones digit of the sum.
            tail = &((*tail)->next);  // Move the tail pointer
        }
        return head;
    }
};
