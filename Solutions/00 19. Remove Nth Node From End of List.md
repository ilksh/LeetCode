# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
1. The code provided aims to remove the nth node from the end of a singly linked list. 
2. To do this, the code first counts the number of nodes in the list.
3. Iterates again until reaching the nth node from the end.
4. Finally, it updates the pointers and removes the nth node from the list.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Initialize a counter cnt to 0, which will store the number of nodes in the linked list.
2. Iterate through the linked list using a pointer c, and for each node encountered, increment cnt by 1.
3. Initialize two pointers 'cur' and 'prev' to keep track of the current and previous nodes, respectively.
4. Iterate through the linked list again, moving cur and prev until reaching the nth node from the end (cnt - n iterations).
5. Adjust the pointers to remove the nth node from the list:
    - If prev is not null, set prev->next to cur->next to bypass the current node.
    - If prev is null, update the head of the list to cur->next.
Return the updated head of the linked list.
# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(1).
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
``` cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        int cnt = 0; // number of nodes

        // iterate to the end in order to count the number of nodes
        for (ListNode* c = head; c != NULL; c = c->next) cnt++;

        ListNode* cur = head;
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        // iterate until nth node from the end of the lis
        for (int i = 0; i < cnt - n; ++i) {
            prev = cur;
            cur = cur->next;
        }

        // if current node is not head
        if (prev != nullptr) prev->next = cur->next;
        // if current node is head
        else head = cur->next;
        
        return head;       
    }
};
