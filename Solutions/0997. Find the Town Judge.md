# Description
In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
To find the judge in the town, we need to identify a person who is trusted by everyone else and does not trust anyone. To determine this, we can calculate the in-degree and out-degree of each person. The person with an in-degree of n - 1 (where n is the total number of people) and an out-degree of 0 would be the potential judge.
# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The approach involves the following steps:

a) Create two arrays: inDegree and outDegree, both initialized with 0s. The size of these arrays is n + 1 to accommodate indices from 1 to n.

b) Iterate over the trust vector and update the in-degree and out-degree arrays accordingly.

c) Finally, iterate over the arrays and check for a person who satisfies the conditions of being trusted by everyone else (in-degree of n - 1) and not trusting anyone (out-degree of 0). Return the index of such a person if found; otherwise, return -1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(E), where E is the number of trust relationships given in the trust vector.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
 O(N), where N is the total number of people in the town.

class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        if (n < 2) return n; // base case
        int inDegree[n +1], outDegree[n +1];
        memset(inDegree, 0, sizeof(inDegree));   // initialize inDegree to 0
        memset(outDegree, 0, sizeof(outDegree)); // initialize outDegree to 0

        for (auto vec : trust) { // iterate all vector(s) in trust
            // node vec[0] trusts node vec[1]
            // vec[0] -> vec[1], thus arrow points from vec[0] to vec[1]
            int curFrom = vec[0];  
            int curTo = vec[1];
            inDegree[curTo]++;     // inDegree means number of people who trust current node
            outDegree[curFrom]++;  // outDegree means number of people current node trusts
        }

        for (int i = 0 ; i < n + 1; ++i) {
            // The town judge trusts nobody = ourDegree is 0
            // Everybody trusts the town judge = inDegree is n -1.
            if (inDegree[i] == n -1 && outDegree[i] == 0) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
