# Description 
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
My code aims to find the number of islands in a grid. An island is represented by a connected component of '1's in the grid. The code uses a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach to explore the grid and count the number of islands.
# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The code iterates over each coordinate in the grid. 
1. When it encounters an unvisited land cell ('1') in the grid, it performs a BFS starting from that cell.
2. During the BFS, it visits all the adjacent land cells and marks them as visited. 
3. This process continues until all connected land cells in the island have been visited. 
4. The code keeps track of the visited cells using the visited array and increments the island count whenever a new island is encountered.
# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(row * col)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O((row + 1) * (col + 1)) 
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
