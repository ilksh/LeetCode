# Description
There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

# Example 
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]

Output: 2

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Initial thoughts on solving this problem would be to use a graph traversal algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), to explore the connected components in the graph.
By identifying the number of connected components, we can determine the number of provinces.
# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. The provided code uses a BFS technique to find the number of connected components (provinces) in the given graph. 
2. It initializes a boolean array to keep track of visited nodes and a queue to perform the BFS traversal. 
3. It starts by iterating over the nodes and, for each unvisited node, performs a BFS traversal to explore all its adjacent nodes. 
4. The number of provinces is incremented for each unvisited node encountered during the BFS traversal.


# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(V + E)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges. 
In this case, the number of edges can be at most $n^2$, as each node can be connected to all other nodes. Therefore, the overall time complexity can be approximated as O($n^2$).

- Space complexity:O(n)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
