# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

This solution uses `top-down` dynamic programming with memoization to efficiently compute the number of distinct ways to climb to the top.

The key idea is that to reach the nth step, you can either come from the `(n-1)th` step or the `(n-2)th` step. Thus, the total number of ways to reach step n is the `sum` of the ways to reach steps `n-1` and `n-2`.

The recursive function `solve(n)` captures this relationship, and memoization is used to cache intermediate results in the dp array to avoid redundant computation. The base cases are straightforward:

- `solve(1)` = 1 (one way to climb one step),

- `solve(2)` = 2 (either two 1-steps or one 2-step).

Before starting the recursion, the entire dp array is initialized to -1, indicating uncomputed states. This ensures that each subproblem is solved at most once, reducing the overall time complexity from exponential to linear O(n).

# Complexity
- Time complexity: `O(n)`
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: `O(n)`
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

# Code
```cpp []
#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    int dp[46]; // max n = 45
    int solve(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return n; // base case

        int& ret = dp[n]; // memoization
        if (ret != -1) return ret; // prevent re-calculation
        ret = solve(n - 1) + solve(n - 2); // there are two ways to reach nth stait
        return ret;
    }
    
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
        return solve(n);
    }
};
