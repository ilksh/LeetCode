# Description
Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return -1.

A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., (0, 0)) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., (n - 1, n - 1)) such that:

All the visited cells of the path are 0.

All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).

The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.

# Example 1
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]

Output: 2

# Example 2
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]

Output: -1

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem can be approached as a graph traversal problem where each cell in the grid represents a node in the graph. We can use BFS and Dijkstra algorithms to find the shortest path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in the grid.


# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Define a pii type representing a pair of integers to store the y-coordinate and x-coordinate of a cell.
2. Array 'dy' and 'dx' to represent eight directions in the grid. The dy and dx arrays store the change in the coordinate for each direction.
3. Initialize a constant INF to a very large value (e.g., 1e9) to represent infinity. This will be used to initialize the dp array.
4. Define a helper function OOB (Out Of Boundary) that checks whether a given coordinate is out of the grid boundaries.
5. In the shortestPathBinaryMatrix function, first check if there is no entrance or exit in the grid. If the sum of the values in the top-left and bottom-right cells is not zero, it means that there is no valid path, and we return -1. (edge case)
6. Initialize all elements of 2D array 'dp' to INF. This array will store the number of visited cells for each path.
7. Utilize a queue 'q' to perform the BFS traversal. Enqueue the top-left cell (0, 0) and set its value in the dp array to 1. (Starting point)
8. Iterate through all possible directions using a loop. For each direction, compute the new coordinates 'ny' and 'nx' by adding the corresponding values.
9. If the new coordinates are out of boundary or the cell is already visited (grid[ny][nx] = 1), skip to the next direction.
10. Otherwise, compute the new score by adding 1 to the current score (dp[curY][curX] + 1).
11. If the new score is smaller than the value in the dp array for the new coordinates, it means that we found a shorter path. Then update the dp array with the new score and enqueue the new coordinates.
12. After the BFS traversal, if the value in dp[n-1][n-1] is still INF, it means that the bottom-right cell was not reached, and there is no valid path. In this case, return -1. Otherwise, we return the value in dp[n-1][n-1], which represents the shortest path length.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
