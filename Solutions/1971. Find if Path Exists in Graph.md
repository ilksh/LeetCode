# Description
There is a bi-directional graph with n vertices, where each vertex is labeled from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a valid path that exists from vertex source to vertex destination.

Given edges and the integers n, source, and destination, return true if there is a valid path from source to destination, or false otherwise.
# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem requires determining whether there is a valid path from a given source node to a destination node in an undirected graph. To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The intuition is to start from the source node and explore its neighboring nodes iteratively until we either reach the destination node or exhaust all possible paths.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Create an adjacency list representation of the graph using a vector of vectors. Each index of the vector represents a node, and the corresponding vector at that index contains its adjacent nodes.
2. Initialize a boolean array called visited of size n+1, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.
3. This array will be used to mark whether a node has been visited during the BFS traversal.
4. Initialize a queue q and enqueue the source node, and mark the source node as visited.
5. While the queue is not empty, repeat steps 6-9.
6. Dequeue a node cur from the front of the queue.
7. Iterate through all the adjacent nodes of cur.
8. For each adjacent node e, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 until the queue becomes empty.
10. After the BFS traversal, check if the destination node has been visited. If it has, return true; otherwise, return false.
# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges in the graph
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the graph.

        vector<int> adj[n + 1]; // adjacent matrix
        for (auto e : edges) {
            int node1 = e[0];
            int node2 = e[1];
            adj[node1].push_back(node2); // undirected graph
            adj[node2].push_back(node1); // undirected graph
        }
         
        bool visited[n + 1]; // visited array to check the node is visited or not
        memset(visited, false, sizeof(visited)); // initialize to false

        queue<int> q; // bfs approach
        q.push(source); // source is always a start
        visited[source] = true;

        while (!q.empty()) { // iterate there are no elements in queue
            auto cur = q.front(); q.pop();  // The front of q means the node that is currently being searched. 
            for (auto e : adj[cur] ) {      // iterate all adjacent nodes
                if (!visited[e]) {          // only traverse non visited node (optimization)
                    visited[e] = true;      // update the information
                    q.push(e);              // add candidates
                }
            }
        }
        // determine whether we can visit from source to destination using bfs method
        bool rst = visited[destination] ? true : false;
        return rst;
