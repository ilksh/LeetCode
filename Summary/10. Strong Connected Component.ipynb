    "## 1489. Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intuition\n",
    "To find the critical and pseudo-critical edges in a minimum spanning tree (MST), we can use Kruskal's algorithm for MST construction. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "1. **Union-Find Structure**:\n",
    "   - Implement union-find to keep track of connected components.\n",
    "   - Use path compression and union by rank to optimize the union-find operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **MST Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Define a function `mst` that calculates the weight of the MST while optionally including or excluding specific edges.\n",
    "   - Use the union-find structure to construct the MST by iterating over the sorted edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Identifying Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges**:\n",
    "   - Calculate the weight of the original MST without any edge constraints.\n",
    "   - For each edge, calculate the MST weight excluding that edge. \n",
    "        - If this weight is greater than the original MST weight, the edge is critical.\n",
    "   - For each edge, calculate the MST weight including that edge from the start. \n",
    "        - If this weight equals the original MST weight, the edge is pseudo-critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
