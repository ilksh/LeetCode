    "# Intuition\n",
    "The problem is to find the number of connected components (provinces) in an undirected graph represented by an adjacency matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation**:\n",
    "   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph based on the given adjacency matrix.\n",
    "   - Use a boolean array `visited` to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Building the Graph**:\n",
    "   - Iterate through the adjacency matrix to populate the adjacency list, representing each connection between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BFS for Connected Components**:\n",
    "   - Use a queue to perform BFS for each unvisited node.\n",
    "   - For each node, mark it as visited and explore all its adjacent nodes, marking them as visited as well.\n",
    "   - After finishing the exploration of a connected component, increment the count of provinces.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Return the Result**:\n",
    "   - The number of provinces is equivalent to the number of connected components in the graph.\n",
