    "\n",
    "# Intuition\n",
    "To find the k-th permutation sequence of numbers from 1 to n, utilize the properties of permutations and factorials. By calculating factorials, we can determine the number of permutations starting with a particular number and directly jump to the k-th permutation without generating all permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "## 1. Create a list of numbers from 1 to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Calculate the factorial of n to use it with the determination of the group size of permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Iterate through the numbers, determining the appropriate group for each position by dividing k by the factorial of the remaining positions. Append the selected number to the result string and remove it from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Group Division Using Factorials**:\n",
    "The total number of permutations of `n` numbers is `n!`. For example, when `n = 4`, the total number of permutations for the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 is `4! = 24`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Size of Each Group**:\n",
    "   By dividing the permutations based on the first number, each group will contain `(n-1)!` permutations. For example, when `n = 4`, the size of each group is `3! = 6`. Therefore, there are 6 permutations starting with 1, 6 permutations starting with 2, 6 permutations starting with 3, and 6 permutations starting with 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Selecting the Group Using k**:\n",
    "   To find the k-th permutation, we determine which group it falls into by dividing `k` by the size of each group `(n-1)!`. For example, if `k = 9`, dividing `k` by 6 gives us `1`, indicating that the 9th permutation is in the group starting with the second smallest number (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Appending the Selected Number and Updating the List**:\n",
    "   The selected number (in this case, 2) is appended to the result string, and removed from the list of available numbers. Then, `k` is updated to `k % (n-1)!` to find the correct position within the current group for the next iteration. \n",
