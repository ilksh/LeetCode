    "# Intuition\n",
    "This can be tackled using dynamic programming (DP) with modified Bellman-Ford algorithm in order to keep track of the minimum cost at each step up to `k` stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to reach node `i` with at most `j` stops.\n",
    "   - Initialize the `dp` array to infinity (`INF`) to represent unreachable states. The size of the array is determined by the number of nodes `n` and the maximum stops `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set Up Base Case**:\n",
    "   - The cost to reach the source node with 0 stops is 0 (`dp[src][0] = 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filling the DP Table**:\n",
    "   - Iterate over the number of stops from 0 to `k`.\n",
    "   - For each stop, update the DP table based on the flight information. This involves relaxing the edges similar to the Bellman-Ford algorithm:\n",
    "     - For each flight from `u` to `v` with cost `w`, if the current cost to reach `u` with `s` stops is less than infinity, update the cost to reach `v` with `s+1` stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Find the Minimum Cost**:\n",
    "   - The result is the minimum cost to reach the destination node `dst` with up to `k` stops. Iterate through the last row of the DP table for the destination node.\n",
